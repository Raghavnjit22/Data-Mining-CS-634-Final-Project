# Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, for a classification task. The dataset used contains features and labels, where the goal is to predict the class labels based on the features.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd your_repository
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras
   ```
4. **Download the Dataset**: Place the `data.csv` file in the project directory.
5. **Run the Script**:
   ```
   python your_script.py
   ```

## Required Packages
- pandas (v1.3.3)
- numpy (v1.21.2)
- matplotlib (v3.4.3)
- seaborn (v0.11.2)
- scikit-learn (v0.24.2)
- keras (v2.6.0)

## Dataset
The dataset (`data.csv`) contains features and labels necessary for training and evaluating the models. Ensure the dataset is in the CSV format and has appropriate columns.

## Model Evaluation
The program evaluates three types of models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

For each model, the script performs 10 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation and calculates various performance metrics including confusion matrix metrics, Brier score, Area Under Curve (AUC), etc.

## Output
The program generates the following outputs:
- Evaluation metrics for each algorithm in each iteration.
- Average performance metrics for each algorithm across all iterations.
- ROC curves for KNN and Random Forest models.

## Running Time
The running time may vary depending on the dataset size and computational resources.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for a classification task. Users can modify the script, dataset, or parameters to suit their specific requirements.
